# switchgrass_cv_application
 The code used for the switchgrass computer vision application for reasearchers at the University of Florida and the University of Missouri.

### Purpose:

The purpose of this application is to extract features from switchgrass photo samples in order to be modeled later.

### Installation:

Installation information will be added later. There will likely be a few different installation methods dependent on if the user intends to manipulate the source code or use the end application.

### Design:

The core of the application resides in three different areas: the functional GUI, the computer vision algorithm, and the ETL pipeline design.

###### Functional GUI

Information for the functional GUI will be added later.

###### Computer vision algorithm

Information for the computer vision algorithm will be added later.

###### ETL pipeline

Information for the ETL pipeline will be added later.

### Future work:

Future work will be added and updated here throughout the lifespan of the project, as well as suggestions for future additions after the project's submission.
